# Langauge_model
Tensorflow Eager implementation for language model.

Text generation is a task in which we generate sentences based on the probability distribution of words learnt by the model from the training data. We trained our model on Leo Tolstoyâ€™s War and Peace so it can understand the style of his writing and try to generate new sentences.

Tensorflow Eager provides the flexibility to use Tensorflow without using graphs, so we can build graphs on the fly during run time.
